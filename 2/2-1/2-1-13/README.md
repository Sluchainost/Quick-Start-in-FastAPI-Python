# TASK DESCRIPTION

Create a **FastAPI** application that accepts a **POST** request to the `/calculate` endpoint with two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) as input. The application should respond with the sum of the two numbers.

For example, a request to `/calculate` with `num1=5` and `num2=10` should return `{"result": 15}` in the response.
